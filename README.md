# Can Can Wonderland Group project
Our client came to us with a unique challenge that required a unique approach to develop. They are creating an 18-hole Artist Designed Minigolf course in their new space and wanted an online tee time reservation system. Can Can Wonderland seeks to infuse art into everything and make it highly accessible. Therefore, our solution needed to be playful, responsive, and even a little bit fun.

It became clear to us early on that we would need to create 3 different views for Can Can Wonderlandâ€™s application. We decided on a very mobile-friendly customer view to request reservations, a tablet-friendly view for the person checking-in golfers, and an administrative view that would allow for configuring the various details of the reservation system, as well as generating reports of customer activity.

Three weeks were slotted for this project, which included client meetings, idea generation, development, and deployment. The technologies our team used included MySQL, Express, Angular, NodeJS, CSS, Passport, Sequelize, Grunt, and a few Angular and Javascript plugins.
